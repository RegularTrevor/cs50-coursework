Problems sets from Harvard's CS50

This work was originally done on CS50's IDE and was copied here. Some problem sets had partial code provided while
others were written from scratch (and one was written in scratch).

Problem Set 0: Scratch

Write a simple game using several sprites and scripts in MIT's scratch language.
