Problems sets from Harvard's CS50

This work was originally done on CS50's IDE and was copied here. Some problem sets had partial code provided while
others were written from scratch (and one was written in scratch).

Problem Set 0: Scratch

Write a simple game using several sprites and scripts in MIT's scratch language.

Problem Set 1: C

Implement several basic C programs to familiarize yourself with the syntax and the logic behind programming.

Hello.c probably speaks for itself.
Water.c calculates the amount of water used when a person showers given as the number of bottles it would fill.
Mario.c creates a mario style pyramid of whatever size the user provides.
Greedy.c is an algorithm that calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make change given a dollar value to be turned into coins.

Problem Set 2: Crypto

Learn basic cryptography and implement several ciphers.

Initials.c takes in a name and outputs that person's initials.
Caesar.c implements Caesar's cipher whichs shifts each letter in a message by a certain provided factor to encrypt it.
Vigenere.c implements Vigenere's cipher which uses a code word instead of a single number and scrambles a message by cycling through the code word using each character's numeric equivalent (a=1, b=2... z= 26) to scramble the message.

Problem Set 3: Game of Fifteen

Helpers.c and Find.c work together to sort and search a large amount of data to find a specific number provided by the user
Fifteen.c implements a [game of fifteen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle) in the command terminal.
